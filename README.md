# TODOMarek is a simple application to remember the work to be done, or to take the notes. 

Notes are grouped in the "Category" -> first column. Categories are created using button: "Add category". Each category is written in a different color.
10 colors are prepared. Lines in the category are added by the button "Add". 
The second column: Each line can be marked with one of the characters displayed on the table. Click on the sign (turns yellow), click on the line to be marked, and the sign will appear in the second column. Sign on the table cease to be a yellow. Click on the mark in the second column erases the character.
Notes (what you need to do) are in the third column. String in the datastore is limited to 500 characters, so description <= 500 characters.
Changing the order of the line:
- Double click on the line you want to switch. The line will be illuminated in yellow.
- Click on the line BEFORE which we want to put the "yellow" line.
You cannot rearrange the notes from one category to another. That's why it is first necessary to do all categories, to set them by importance, and then add lines for each category.
Canceling adjustment: Click on the yellow line, or using any other function.

Button "Delete" is used to remove the line. 
Button "Save" saves the data in the datastore. 
"Cancel" displays data from the last use "Save".
